# Hotel-Booking-Data-Visualization
The project is about making visualization with existing datasets. The dataset is about the hotels that are booked in every country. Data cleaning and preparation were carried out in Excel, and then analysis and visualization were made using Tableau software.

The image above is a dashboard with visualization tables, graphs (bar charts), and maps. The dashboard above visualizes a map of the distribution of hotel types, visitors, and the rate of booking cancellations per year. Country visualization based on hotel type is used to filter so that readers can see the type and level of hotel visitors and hotel booking cancellations from each country.

The picture above is a visualization of continents and countries based on the total number of unique hotels per year. This visualization uses the map layer function to see the unlimited special hotel requests from the selected continent and country. Then use the filter per year to see the progress of the total special requests yearly.

The story above can provide information on the types of hotels in each country and the number of hotel visitors divided into 3, namely Agent, Company, and Standard. Then we can also see the number of booking cancellations for each type of hotel from year to year, where "Visualization of Countries Based on Hotel Type" is used as a filter for dashboards and stories.
